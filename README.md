# Code example: simply_news skeleton

A few files from the "simply news" project for code example purposes. 

The real project uses:
- [Firebase auth](https://pub.dev/packages/firebase_auth) for authentication.
- [Cloud firestore](https://cloud.google.com/firestore/) as database.
- [Spacy](https://spacy.io/) and [Sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html) for Natural Language Processing (tokenisation, NER, text classification, topic modelling, text summarisation,...).

It aims at helping english learners by reading through simplified articles focusing on vocabulary specific to the learning stage of the reader. The application will follow a learning methodology ultimately aimning to teach learners to get by in many situations using limited vocabulary.
